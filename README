this project is for saving off server configuration information and
is primarily used to keep staging and production servers in synch. 

each 'type' of server has a directory under servers directory.  
any file that is configured specifically for that type of server is 
listed under that directory. 

usage:
- files are edited and tested on the server

- clone the repo on a server as root
	cd ~
	git clone git@github.com:gn0m30/server_configs.git
	
- set a GN0M30_SERVER_TYPE environment variable on the server the 
  matches a server type directory.

- edit and test files on the server, adding them to the files.yml under the 
  appropriate server type directory. the files listed in that file will be 
  copied into the appropriate directory under the server type directory by 
  running:
	rake reap
	
- to synchronize a new repo, make sure sites are enabled, and restart appropriate
  services, run:
	rake sow

current server types:

	tiny_ruby
	AWS server for ruby and sinatra apps using ree, passenger, and ngnix
		hosts the following sites:
			ctrain
			sassywood
			bankofbs
